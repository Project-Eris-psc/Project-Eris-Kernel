config MTK_UART_USB_SWITCH
	bool "MediaTek UART could use USB DATA pins"
	help
		This is a feature for debugging purpose.
		It uses the USB TX/RX as UART TX/RX.
		A USB to UART cable is needed to use this feature.
		Using the UI in the EngineerMode to switch between USB and UART mode.
		After switching to UART mode and connect to the PC with a USB to UART cable,
		you can connect to a Virtual COM port on the PC and get the log output to the UART console.

config USB_VBUSDET_IN_GPIO
	bool "MediaTek MUSB is used to detect vBus event via GPIO"
	help
		Some application have no PMIC design or vBus is not connected with VCDT in PMIC,
		therefore. MTK MUSB is used to use one GPIO input to detect vBus event.
		Actually, we need other GPIO pin to manipulate vBus power supply for Host role,
		and the GPIO will make vBus power off when device role.
		If unsure, say N.

config USB_PHYCHK_EXTCONN
	bool "MediaTek MUSB to detect USB external connector with phy test mode"
	help
		To detect USB simple external connector with MTK phy test mode.
		invoke mt_usb_phychk_extconn to get usb external connector
