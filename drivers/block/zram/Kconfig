	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

	  This option enables LZ4 compression algorithm support. Compression
	  algorithm can be changed using `comp_algorithm' device attribute.

        This is a hardware implementation layer for hwzram block device driver,
        which is used to control hardware operations of specific HW modules.
        This is used to replace ZRAM with faster HW compression/decompression
        or better compression ratio.
        If there is corresponding hardware module, please enable it.

config HWZRAM_DRV
       bool "Block device on top of hardware version of ZRAM"

       help
        Block device on top of hardware version of ZRAM.
        Before enabling HWZRAM_IMPL, you should enable this option.
        This imitates the implementation of ZRAM but with the hook of HW
        implementation in HWZRAM_IMPL.

config HWZRAM_DEBUG
       bool "Debug message for hardware version of ZRAM"
       default n
       help
        Debug option for hwzram driver.
        This is an option for development. You can enable it to
        get more information about HW compression/decompression
        flow and try to enhance it.
