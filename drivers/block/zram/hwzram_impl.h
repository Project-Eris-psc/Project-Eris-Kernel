 * Why do we have this "impl" thing?
 *
 * Its purpose is to separate out the code which interacts with the
 * hardware from the layers above it -- i.e. either zram (block
 * device) or zswap (front swap) or anything else.  This code also
 * handles memory allocation, so layers above might need to call into
 * this code to free up memory that is no longer used.
